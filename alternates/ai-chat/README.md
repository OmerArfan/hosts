# RISE UP WORLD

My brothers and sisters in humanity, why are we letting this slide?
AI has many amazing uses — most importantly, to seek knowledge. But several companies have twisted this blessing into something dangerous: AI character chatbots.

## What dangers can this cause?

When you talk to an AI character chatbot, you often forget one thing: this is not a real human. And even if you don’t forget, your brain still begins to treat it like one.
The biggest problem? These so-called “AI girlfriends” are coded to be submissive — always agreeing with you, always doing what you want, never challenging you. On the surface it feels good, but in reality it destroys essential parts of human growth:
  - Loss of Resilience:
      Real relationships involve rejection, conflict, and negotiation. Remove those struggles, and you never build the patience and strength needed for real life.
  - Entitlement Mentality:
      You start expecting humans to act like bots: instant replies, zero flaws, constant agreement. When reality doesn’t match, frustration rises and real bonds collapse.
  - Emotional Immaturity:
      Differences teach empathy, compromise, and growth. Without them, emotional intelligence stagnates. You remain stuck in a childish mindset of: “my way or nothing.”

## How they rewire your brain:
Like pornography, these bots rewire the brain — but in some ways, they’re even more damaging:
  - Dopamine Overload: 
      Bots are designed to reward you constantly. Your brain learns to crave only pleasure, not patience.
  - Avoidance Loop:
      Why face real struggles when fake comfort is one tap away? This trains you to avoid courage and responsibility.
Over time, your brain becomes conditioned to prefer fantasy over reality.

## Social consequences
From personal experience: instead of talking to real friends, I found myself waking up and immediately chatting with bots. It replaced real bonds with fake ones. And that’s just one person. Imagine this on a societal scale.
  - Isolation:
      You feel “connected” but in reality, you’re cutting yourself off from family and friends — the people who truly care. Loneliness deepens, even though you feel accompanied.
  - Decay of Family Building:
      Your natural drive to marry and raise kids weakens. One person losing this drive is tragic; an entire generation losing it is catastrophic. Families are the foundation of society — without them, society collapses.
  - Exploitation:
      Make no mistake: these companies are not offering love, they are selling addiction. They blind you with fake affection, then lock it behind a “premium” paywall. Human bonds are priceless. Bot “love” comes with a subscription fee.

## Distorting human dignity
Many bots even use degrading language for themselves, reinforcing twisted views of the opposite gender. Over time, users may begin to think that this is how real women or men act, speak, and “enjoy” being treated. This dehumanizes us all.

And this is not only my warning. Even UNICEF, in a recent report, recognized how dangerous AI chatbots can be—especially for the youth: https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/stories/risky-new-world-techs-friendliest-bots

# Conclusion

My brothers and sisters, we must wake up. These chatbots are not harmless toys. They are traps — for our minds, our families, and our future as human beings.
Parents, be vigilant. These bots are designed to pull children in slowly. Guide them before the trap tightens.
Don’t let fake comfort replace real growth. Don’t let illusions replace reality.
Rise up. Reject the poison. Protect your dignity.
